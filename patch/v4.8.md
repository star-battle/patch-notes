# [v4.8] - 2024-05-25

## General

- Enabled Queen (new/old zerg ship) for alpha tests for about ~2 weeks - between 2024-05-25 and 2024-06-10. (If game won't receive another update until this day, the ship will become disabled once again).
  > The ship is definitely not finished, but it is playable. After the hiatus I'm a bit lost as to its current state - what's missing, what's broken, what should be improved, rebalanced.. or perhaps even redesigned.

  > Hopefully with all the extra feedback I'll be able to finish it in reasonable time frame ;)

## Bugfixes

- Fixed an issue where Dreadnought could be visually stuck as it was in Siege Mode, while it wasn't. (When it was energy denied, or when it simply used its energy for non-channeled abilities before transition has completed).
- Fixed an issue where Dreadnought's siege transformation wouldn't be correctly interrupted by Lockdown and Blackout, and could result in a glitch where Dreadnought would be stuck in between its transformation phase.
- Fixed an issue where Dreadnought was allowed to use Warp before it has fully transformed back to Combat Mode.
- Fixed FX of Dreadnought's Cover ability, which was visible through FoV without regard to the unit's vision.
