## [1.1] - 2021-08-04

General:
- Updated loading screen artwork to a final version (*probably*). Thanks to AmigoDeer!
- *Slightly* increased scale of Vikings and Phoenixes.
- Light units are no longer targetable by move ability.

Arbiter:
- Force Field: duration reduced from 5s to 4s.

Guardian:
- Broodlings:
  - Bonus damage to claws increased from 2.2 to 2.5 per each level of Broodlings upgrade. (It was already buffed in previous patch, but we haven't nailed the value at the time).
- Corruptors:
  - Base damage reduced from 20 (+10 massive) to 15 (+5 massive).
  - Model's scale increased by ~30%

Bugfixes:
- Fixed Frigate starting with 8.0 range, instead of 7.5 range as it was previously.
- Fixed Arbiter being unable to turn off the cloaking field, while having Phantom of itself (or another Arbiter) in its selection.
- Fixed missing impact FX on Explosive Charge.
- Fixed missing impact shockwave on BC's Nuke, when not connected with the target.
- Fixed Corruptor being tinted in a green color, instead of using team colors.
- Fixed Broodlords having two actors - they'd stack on top of each other (as if there were two units, but it was one).
- Fixed learn ability of Guardian that would allow getting Parasite upgrade past the range of base.
- Fixed out of date tooltip description on "Learn Parasite", and missing passive button after the upgrade.
- Fixed tooltip on Decay - where it wouldn't display all details until ability has been learned.
- Fixed tooltip of Posthumous Mitosis - where it would display description of Decay instead.
